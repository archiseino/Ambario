# Ambario

Part of Final Project of Multimedia

## Getting Started

- You can clone this repo first and create an environment using the conda with this command

```
conda env create --file enviroment.yml
```

- This will create an enviroment with the name of `py310_multimedia`. You can activate by doing this

```
conda activate py310_multimedia
```

- Also for the record the successful proto is the `Ambario.py` program (right now)

```
python Ambario.py
```
